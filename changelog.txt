General FPS Improvements
Menu Rendering Trim - the menu now fully stops drawing when it’s closed, so it doesn’t cost FPS in the background.
Smarter Draw Queue - skipped extra draw work when there’s nothing to render on screen.
Inventory Still Applies - skins still auto‑load in the background even when the menu is closed.

Overlay FPS Trim
Overlay Auto‑Skip - when every overlay is turned off (and the menu is closed), the overlay system now stays fully idle to save FPS.

Watermark FPS Trim
Smarter Drag Check - the watermark only updates when it’s on or when your cursor is near it for dragging.
