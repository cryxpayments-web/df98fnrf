Lua API Expansion
Config Controls - Lua scripts can now get and set float, int, and string config values (not just bools).
Player & Weapon Helpers - added armor/helmet/defuse/scoped/defusing/money/eye‑pos/2D speed plus active weapon info (clip, name, spread, inaccuracy).
Extra Math Tools - new FOV, angle/vector conversions, and random range helpers for scripting.
