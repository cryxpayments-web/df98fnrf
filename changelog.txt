**changelog:** `01/05/2026` 

## Inventory / Loadout
- **Fixed Loadout Not Saving** - Equipped skins in lobby now persist correctly (saved to `equipped_items.json`) and restore on next launch.
- **Improved Auto-Restore Reliability** - Inventory + loadout restore now retries automatically (lobby + in-game) until fully ready, similar to ReevInventory behavior.

## Skins / Gloves
- **Fixed Glove Rendering Inconsistency** - Gloves now apply more reliably by reapplying across more frames and recovering when gloves aren’t initialized yet (fixes “sometimes renders, sometimes not”).
