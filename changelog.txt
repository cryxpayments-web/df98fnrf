## Legitbot
- **Smoothing Type Renamed** - The old smoothing type **"Slow"** has been renamed to **"Human"** (same option, just a clearer name).
- **Human Smoothing Fixed** - "Human" smoothing now moves more naturally instead of feeling broken/unnatural.
- **More Natural Aim Movement** - Human smoothing now:
  - slows down smoothly as your crosshair gets closer to the target
  - adds tiny, subtle hand-like movement so it doesn't look robotic
- **Config Compatible** - Your existing configs will still work normally (no reset needed).

## World Visuals
- **Smoke Color** - New option to customize smoke grenade color with full RGB color picker.
