> ## Radar / Minimap
> - **New Circular Design** - The radar is now a clean circle instead of a rectangle, giving it a proper minimap look.
> - **Matches Menu Theme** - The radar border and player marker now use your menu's accent color for a consistent look.
> - **Draggable Anywhere** - You can now drag the radar by clicking anywhere on it, not just the header.
> - **Cleaner Map Display** - The map texture now stays perfectly inside the circle with no overflow.
> - **Smoother Visuals** - Added subtle inner border and refined styling for a more polished appearance.
