> ## Grenade Prediction (Trajectory Line)
> - **New “Thin” Line Style** - The default grenade prediction line is now a clean, thin, smooth line that’s easier to read.
> - **Only Shows While Aiming** - The prediction line only appears when you’re actually preparing a throw (aiming), not all the time.
> - **Instantly Disappears After Throw** - The line stops drawing the moment you throw the grenade (no leftover line after release).
> - **Cleaner + Faster** - Reduced extra visual clutter and optimized drawing so it uses less performance.
> 
> ## Grenade Prediction Effect (On-Grenade Indicator)
> - **Smaller Effect** - The on-grenade indicator is now smaller and less intrusive.
> - **One-Time Spawn Per Throw** - The effect is created when you throw the grenade and stays with that grenade.
> - **Correct Expiration** - The effect now disappears right when the throwable itself expires (no late or early expiration).
> - **Timer Behavior Improved** - The timer only shows while time is remaining (it won’t stay stuck showing `0.0`).
