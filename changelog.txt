Triggerbot Enhancements
Smarter Timing - The triggerbot now has a "Delay Jitter" setting that adds small random variations to make shots feel more natural and human-like.
Reaction Floor - New minimum reaction time setting so the bot never shoots faster than humanly possible, even with low delay values.
Target Confirmation - New "Visibility Ticks" option makes the triggerbot wait a moment before shooting, reducing accidental shots when quickly panning past enemies.
Shot Spacing - New setting to limit how fast the triggerbot can fire, giving you more control over fire rate.
