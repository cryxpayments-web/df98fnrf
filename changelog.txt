Legitbot / Assisted Recoil
Improved Recoil Control - Assisted Recoil now uses smarter tracking that actually stabilizes your spray.
No More Fighting - Fixed an issue where Assisted Recoil would fight against the aimbot's smoothing, causing jittery aim.
Works When You Need It - Recoil control now only kicks in when you're spraying without a target. When aiming at someone, the normal RCS handles it automatically.
Smoother Sprays - Overall spray control feels more consistent and effective.
