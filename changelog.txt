> ## Skins / Inventory
> - **Fixed Wrong “Legacy” Skin Rendering** - Some skins could look incorrect (wrong model/finish). This is now fixed so skins match what you selected.
> - **More Reliable Skin Adding** - When you add a skin, it now correctly remembers the right skin type so it applies properly in-game.
> - **Safer Skin Values** - Added extra safety checks for paint kit / seed / wear so invalid values don’t cause weird results.
> 
> ## Stability / Crash Prevention
> - **Safer Knife/HUD Refresh** - Reduced the chance of crashes or glitches when updating knife icons/skins.
> - **More Stable Material Updates** - Skin material/composite updates are now handled more safely to prevent random issues.
