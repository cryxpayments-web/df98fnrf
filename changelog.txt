Discord - Match Detection 🎮
Same Match Alert - If you're in a CS2 match with another Reev user, both of you will get pinged in Discord automatically.
Instant Notification - As soon as the match starts, you'll know if a fellow Reev user is in your game.
Match Details - The alert shows who's in your match, the map you're playing, and the game mode.

How It Works
Automatic - No setup needed! Just play as normal and the bot handles everything.
Same Server Detection - The cheat checks if other Reev users joined the same server as you.
Discord Ping - When detected, everyone in that match gets pinged in the Reev Discord.
