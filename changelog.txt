Legitbot / Hitboxes
Per-Weapon Hitboxes - Hitbox priorities are now saved separately for each weapon category (Pistol / Rifle / SMG / Sniper / Shotgun / LMG).
No More Global Hitbox - Changing hitboxes for one category no longer changes the others.
Share Option Improved - If you disable “Share across all categories”, your current hitbox setup is copied to all categories so nothing breaks.
